# Project-Proposal

<span><strong>Team Members: *Benjamin Nelson*, *Jonathan Randolph*, *Lei Kang*, *Patricia Mayer*</strong></span>

<p><strong>Project Outline:</strong></p>

<p>We plan to analyze housing costs and their relations to a variety of factors, with a focus on weather data, for apartments, houses, and other housing variants.</p>

<p><strong>Research Questions:</strong></p>

<p>How does price (or price/area?) relate to:<ol>
  
  <li>Likelihood of flooding/Cost of flood insurance?</li>
  <li>Average lot size?</li>
  <li>Crime rates?</li>
  <li>Proximity to amenities (Bars/restaurants)?</li></ol></p>
  
<p><strong>Data Sets to be Used:</strong></p>

<p><ul>
  <li>https://www.zillow.com/</li>
  <li>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenDataDE/State-zip-code-GeoJSON/master/tx_texas_zip_codes_geo.min.json</li>
  <li>https://search.onboard-apis.com/propertyapi/v1.0.0/property</li>
  <li>https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8d515a90e80840b3bc7a3ada352b0d15_0.geojson</li>
  <li>https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json</li></ul></p>

<p><strong>Rough Breakdown of Tasks:</strong></p>

<p><ul>
  <li>Filter datasets to be used</li>
  <li>Pull useful data from datasets</li>
  <li>Further refine questions</li>
  <li>Explore data</li>
  <li>Create figures showing relation of housing prices to each</li></ul></p>

# Final-Insights

<p><ul>
  <li>House square footage matters to the price you'll pay; but the lot has little effect.</li>
  <li>Flooding has some effect on the price; but requires more research.</li>
  <li>The more you pay, the more likely you are to have non-violent crime happening in your area. Violent crime rates stay about the same.</li>
  <li>The more restaurants in an area, the more the average cost.</li>
  <li>And lastly, downtown Houston is expensive.</li></ul></p>
